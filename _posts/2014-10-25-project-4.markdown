When working solo, I use the Kanban method to track products from conception to completion. Since implementing this workflow, I have seen a drastic increase both productivity and increased awareness of a current product's state with product owners. While I have tried several Kanban board tools, I have found JIRA to be the most flexible. Especially as I transition from individual work and group work.

I have recently been introduced to Scrum while working with a team of four engineers. After attending a recent workshop in Boulder, I'm extreamely exited to dive headfirst into working with a team that focuses on increased software releases, as well as improved code through automated testing (Ghost.js, Slimer.js).
